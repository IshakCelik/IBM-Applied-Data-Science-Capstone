# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
üéØ Project Objective & Overview
This capstone project represents the final milestone in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal is to apply the full data science workflow in a real-world context and present the entire journey‚Äîfrom data collection to model deployment‚Äîin the form of a compelling, technically detailed presentation.

The final deliverable is a structured slide deck tailored for a peer audience of data scientists. It will cover all phases of the project, enriched with visualizations, dashboards, and predictive insights. While a PowerPoint template is provided, we are encouraged to expand it with original charts, tables, and innovative insights. Once complete, this technical report will also serve as the foundation for a higher-level summary that can be adapted for executive stakeholders.

üîç Summary of Methods and Workflow
1. Data Collection

Accessed SpaceX launch data through the official REST API

Performed web scraping on Wikipedia to supplement missing or inconsistent data

2. Data Wrangling

Cleaned and filtered the raw dataset

Handled missing values appropriately

Used One-Hot Encoding to transform categorical variables for machine learning

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted descriptive analysis using Python visualization libraries

Executed analytical SQL queries to reveal trends and patterns in the data

4. Interactive Visual Analytics

Created interactive maps with Folium

Developed a live dashboard using Plotly Dash for real-time data exploration

5. Predictive Modeling

Trained and compared multiple classification algorithms

Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
